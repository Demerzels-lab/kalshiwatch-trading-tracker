The response indicates if the core exchange is active (`exchange_active`), if trading is currently permitted (`trading_active`), and provides an optional estimated resume time if the exchange is under maintenance (`exchange_estimated_resume_time`). This endpoint requires no request parameters and returns a JSON object.",
